# About Me

## Introduction

Hey there! 👋

I'm a B.Tech student at the [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.mbm.ac.in/deptt-of-computer-science-engineering) department of [MBM University](https://www.mbm.ac.in/).

🚀 Passionate about Open Source, I've contributed to various organizations, helping build and improve projects that benefit the community. Coding for Open Source is not just a hobby for me — *it's a way of life!*

💻 With 6 months of experience as a full stack developer, I'm constantly evolving and embracing new technologies.

🌱 Currently diving deep into Next.js, TypeScript, and WebSockets, while also working on building my own library.

🤝 Always excited to collaborate on impactful Open Source projects.

Let's build something amazing together! 🌟
